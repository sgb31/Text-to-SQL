This project is designed to make accessing medical data simple for everyone. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, users can type questions in plain English, 
like “Show patients whose left eye vision improved after cataract surgery.”

The system intelligently interprets the query, applies medical rules to calculate vision changes, and generates an accurate SQL query to fetch results from the database. It ensures reliability, handles tricky medical logic automatically, and keeps logs for accountability.

The impact is significant: it saves time, reduces errors, and allows doctors, researchers, or administrative staff to get insights instantly without any technical knowledge.

The architecture diagrams attached will help you understand the workflow much, much better—they show step by step how user input flows through AI models and rule engines to produce the final data.
